## Surfs Up Summary
The last bullet point the 75% quartile in the results is the most critical part of this analysis. The lower temperatures in December will make it less ideal for our business. We should consider if we would plan to be open during that time or if would operate on a seasonal schedule. Additional analysis should be completed on this data to review the following: 
- For Decmeber, I would propose completing an additional review specifically identify the amount of days within the month do not exceed the minimum temperature of June which is 64 degrees. We should expand this review to determine what days in December are impacted. 
- The dataset includes fields for precipitation data. We should compile the precipitation data as well to determin if either month is significantly impacted by precipitation. We should overlay the precipitation data with the temperature data to determine if there is a coorelation between the two items.
