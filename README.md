# Surfs Up Temperature Review

## Overview of Surfs Up Temperature Review
### An analysis of temperature data was completed to review the temperatures in Oahu for the months of June and December. The review included identifying the mean temperature by month, maximum temperature by month, min temperature by month and the data quartiles by month. 

## Results of Surfs Up Temperature Review
Below is a summary of the key differences between June and December temperatures as well as the summary tables created: 
- The mean temperature for June is 74.94 degrees compared to mean temperature for December of 71.04 degrees.
- Both months have a similar maximum temperature with June max temperature of 85 degrees and December max temperature of 83 degrees. 
- The largest variance is the minimum temperatures. December has a minimum that is 8 degrees lower at 56 degrees verses June's minimum of 64 degrees. 
- December has over 75% of records with a lower temperature than the mean temperature of June.

## Surfs Up Summary
The last bullet point the 75% quartile in the results is the most critical part of this analysis. The lower temperatures in December will make it less ideal for our business. We should consider if we would plan to be open during that time or if would operate on a seasonal schedule. Additional analysis should be completed on this data to review the following: 
- For December, I would propose completing an additional analysis to identify the amount of days within the month that do not exceed the minimum temperature of June, which is 64 degrees. We should expand this review to determine the weeks in December impacted. This could help us make a decision on if we should operate for the entire month. 
- The database includes fields for precipitation data. We should compile the precipitation data as well to determine if either month is significantly impacted by precipitation. We should overlay the precipitation data with the temperature data to determine if there is a correlation between the two items.
